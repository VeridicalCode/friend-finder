# Friend Finder

## What Is This Thing?
A social compatibility app that tries to match users with each other based on responses to personality questions.

## How Do I Use It?
The app is hosted on Heroku. Navigating to [the host page there](https://sleepy-eyrie-81525.herokuapp.com/) will open the home page, and clicking the button there will launch the survey.

## Who Made It?
All local code was written solely by myself, Mars Getsoian. Bootstrap is courtesy of its creators, and source images are provided by the SyFy promotional team.

## Are There Bugs?
Attempting to sumbit a survey with missing values will throw an appropriate error message, but still attempt to serve a survey. There's also no dedicated server, so users can only match with the pre-set user group, or with other users within the same session.
